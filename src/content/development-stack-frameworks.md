## Introduction  Framework Overview

### Understanding Stack Frameworks

Stack frameworks bundle tools and libraries to streamline web and mobile app development. They offer a standardized environment for developers, encompassing the core application layers: front-end, back-end, database, and more.

Frameworks address key elements:
- **Code Organization**
- **Scalability**
- **Security**
- **Maintainability**

Developers must assess factors like project size, complexity, and team expertise when choosing a framework.
